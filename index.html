				<b><p class="title">Hello, I'm Isaac Samuel.</p></b>
				<p>...Although you'll catch my attention more consistently with the word "coffee". I programmed my first website when I was a twelve year old with a burning desire to share his nigh-encyclopedic Pok&eacute;mon knowledge with the world. This eventually led to me hacking the games, which led to an even more general interest in programming, which led me to study computer science at Temple University... I don't know why I swallowed the fly, perhaps I'll die.</p>
				<p>When I'm not trying to build palaces out of math, I'm being ridiculed by foriegn children whilst travelling on a shoestring. I like to read about other's adventures and write (poorly) about my own misadventures. My sister keeps sending me (what I can only imagine are exorbitantly-priced) exotic types of coffee, but honestly, I can't taste the difference. If you want to know more, scroll down, download my resume on the right, or contact me.</p>
